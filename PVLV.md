# PVLV: Primary Value, Learned Value

This is a ground-up rewrite of PVLV [Mollick et al, 2020](#references) for axon, designed to capture the essential properties of the [Go leabra version](https://github.com/emer/leabra/tree/master/pvlv) in a yet simpler and cleaner way.  Each layer type is implemented in a more self-contained manner using the axon trace-based learning rule, which has better natural affordances for DA modulation.  Thus, these can be used in a more mix-and-match manner (e.g., the BLA can be used to train OFC, independent of its phasic dopamine role).

This is an incremental work-in-progress, documented as it goes along.

# BLA

BLA does X.

There are 2x2 BLA types: Positive or Negative valence US's with Acquisition vs. Extinction:

* BLAPosD1 = Pos / Acq
* BLAPosD2 = Pos / Ext
* BLANegD2 = Neg / Acq
* BLANegD1 = Neg / Ext

The D1 / D2 flips the sign of the influence of DA on the plus-phase activation of the BLA neuron (D1 = excitatory, D2 = inhibitory).

A major simplification and improvement in the axon version is that the extinction neurons receive from the OFC neurons that are activated by the corresponding acquisition neurons, thus solving the "learn from disappointment" problem in a much better way: when we are OFC-expecting a given US, and we give up on that and suck up the negative DA, then the corresponding BLA ext neurons get punished.

The (new) learning rule based on the axon trace code is:

* DWt = lr * (1 + g * abs(DA)) * abs(CaSpkP - SpkPrv) * Tr_prv * (CaSpkP - SpkPrv)
    + CaSpkP: current trial plus phase Ca -- has DA modulation reflected in a D1 / D2 direction
    + SpkPrv: CaSpkP from the previous ThetaCycle (trial).  Thus, as in the Leabra PVLV, the outcome / US is compared to the prior t-1 trial.
    + Tr_prv: is S * R trace from *previous* time (i.e., not yet reflecting new Tr update -- as in CTPrjn)
    + The DA modulation of learning rate is implemented via RLrate factor, in NeuroMod field.  This also includes the `Diff` lrate factor as in standard axon, which is likewise based on the between-trial diff as opposed to the plus - minus phase differences.

# CeM

For now, CeM is only serving as an integration of BLA `Acq` and `Ext` inputs, representing the balance between them.  This uses non-learning projections and mostly CeM is redundant with BLA anyway.  This also elides the function CeL (TODO: make sure this is OK!).
