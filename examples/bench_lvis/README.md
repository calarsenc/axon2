# Bench LVis

bench_lvis is supposed to be an easy-to-understand, easy-to-run network that nevertheless has the same performance characteristics as the big LVis network.
As compared to examples/bench_objrec, bench_lvis has much less code.

Currently includes:
- 4 layers, with a mix of random connections, local connections, dense connections

TODOs:
- [ ] Network doesn't converge. Not really a problem if we're just looking to test performance, but would be nice to get working.
- [ ] No GUI. Would be nice to make it easier to understand connectivity patterns.
