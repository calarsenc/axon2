# gabab

Explores the GABA-B dynamics from Thomson & Destexhe, 1999

Based on Fig 15, using a double-exponential function with 60 msec time to peak, and roughly 200 msec time to return to baseline, along with sigmoidal function of spiking for peak conductance, and the Mg inverse rectification curve.

Double exponential can't quite fit the right time-course, but 45 rise and 50 decay gives pretty reasonable looking overall distribution with peak at 47, and about .2 left after 200 msec. 35 / 40 has peak around 37 and .1 left after 100.
