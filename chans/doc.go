Package chans provides standard neural conductance channels for computing
a point-neuron approximation based on the standard equivalent RC circuit
model of a neuron (i.e., basic Ohms law equations).
Includes excitatory, leak, inhibition, and dynamic potassium channels.

It also includes implementations of other important types of channels
such as NMDA, GABA-B, and VGCC.
